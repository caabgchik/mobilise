# 2.0.0 (2017-05-05)

* Force using a predefined vertex shader, and force the varyings and uniforms in the fragment shader. This will make things simpler for most users. It also breaks backwards compat.
* Added a interactive REPL!

# 1.1.0

* Added a `aLatLngCoords` attribute
* Repurposed the `aCRSCoords` attribute: it now handles the tile's CRS coordinates, not its `LatLng` coordinates
* Added the "Tropical" demo

# 1.0.1

* Switch to subclassing from `GridLayer` instead of `TileLayer` to properly
  handle async draws and remove glitching.
* Prettified filenames and updated refs in `package.json`.
* Fixed CRS coords orientation *again* because GL coords systems are insane.
* Linting.

# 1.0.0

* Initial release
* Three demos (mandelbrot, terrain-rbg, antitoner)
